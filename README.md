# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Michael Chan*



## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Red is the power, brown is the ground and ornage is the signal.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

It should be on pin 9 per the myservo.attach line of code.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The angle is controlled by the intialization of the for loops.  The 180 to 0 tells the servo to rotate from 0 to 180 degrees.  The steps in the for loop indicate how fast it should change angle, in this case it is set at 1 degree.  

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
